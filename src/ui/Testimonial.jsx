              I was welcomed into Zen as I arrived at Meganâ€™s treatment space.
              Peaceful music, light scents and mystical art set the tone for a
              transformative two hour massage. More than a massage, it was a
              spiritual experience and felt like my soul was healing along with
              my body. The luxurious treatment gently but firmly addressed
              tension in every part of my body. She used quality oils and warm
              towels and exfoliated and hydrated my skin while relaxing my
              muscles. I get massages regularly, and this was by far one of my
              favorite treatments. Thank you Megan! Ill be back!
